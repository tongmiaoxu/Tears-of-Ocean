# Tears of the Ocean: Mechanical Art Installation
This project simulates the transformation of the ocean from clean to polluted. A row of rotating gears represents the ocean, moving from a lively to a lifeless state. Sewage is introduced into a water tank via a pipe, and a water-lifting device moves the sewage while the motor adjusts based on the water's weight. The tanks have holes that gradually open as the front tank fills, allowing the water to flow back for recycling. LED lights turn on when the ocean is clean and turn off when the cycle ends, indicating the polluted state.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tamphie/Tears-of-Ocean.git
   ```
2. Run the system: Set Up your hardwares and run **final_code**!

## How to Test the Functions

### 1. **Button and LED Test**
To test the button interaction function and how it controls the signal light:
- Run the **button_and_led_test** to check the interaction between the button and the LED signal light. This will ensure that pressing the button triggers the correct behavior of the signal light.

### 2. **Motor PID Control Test**
To test the function of the motor’s PID control of the shaft:
- Run the **motortest** to evaluate how the motor adjusts the shaft position based on the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control system.

### 3. **LED RGB Effects**
To test the LED's dazzling effects:
- Run the **led** to see how the LEDs perform various color-changing effects. This will demonstrate the RGB lighting capabilities.

### 4. **Force Reading Sensor Test**
To see how the force reading sensor captures and processes signals:
- Run the **forcereading** to check the functionality of the force sensor, observing how it reads and reports force data.
